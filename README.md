# Hotel Reservation Application
## Java Programming Nanodegree - Course 2 - Java Fundamentals

In this project, I’ve designed and implemented a **Hotel Reservation Application**. This application allows customers to find and book hotel rooms based on availability. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my abilities in designing classes using **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, organizing and processing data with **collections**, and utilizing common **Java types**.

## Main Components of the App
The major components of the Hotel Reservation Application consists of the following:
1. **CLI for the User Interface** - I have used the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. This means, Java monitors the CLI for user input, allowing users to enter commands to search for available rooms, book rooms, and perform other actions.
2. **Java code** - The second main component is the Java code itself, here I have implemented the **business logic** for the application.
3. **Java collections** - Finally, I’ve used Java collections for **in-memory storage** of the data we need for the app, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.

## Application Architecture
Let's talk about the structure or architecture of the application. The app is separated into the following layers:
1. **User interface (UI)**, includes a main menu for the users who want to book a room, and an admin menu for administrative functions.
2. **Resources**, acts as our Application Programming Interface (API) to our UI.
3. **Services**, communicates with our resources, and each other, to build the business logic necessary to provide feedback to our UI.
4. **Data models**, is used to represent the domain that we're using within the system (e.g., rooms, reservations, and customers).
